*Project Summary: Driving License Management System*  

*Description:*  
A desktop application built using *C#, applying **OOP principles, **3-tier architecture, and **clean code practices*.  

*Key Features:*  
1. *License Management:*  
   - Apply for licenses, pay fees, and complete 3 tests (theoretical, practical, vision) to issue a license.  
   - Request international licenses, replacements, or handle fines and suspensions.  

2. *Automation & User Management:*  
   - Automatic driver registration after issuing the first license.  
   - Manage requests, user details, and employee data.  

3. *Security:*  
   - Passwords encrypted using *one-way encryption* and stored securely in the registry when needed.  

This project demonstrates my ability to develop a full-featured, secure system independently.
